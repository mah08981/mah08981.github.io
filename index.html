<h3> About
</h3>
<P>
Bangles by Mollie is a jewelry company started in 2014 in Royston, Georgia by Mollie Herndon. Frustrated with
outrageous prices for jewelry in local boutiques, Mollie decided to learn how to make jewelry herself.
Mollie began by making wire bangles, and has now expanded to bracelets, necklaces, rings, 
chokers and more! Every piece is unique and handcrafted to perfection, with intricate designs and extreme
attention to detail. Bangles by Mollie was created with a mission to deliver trendy, 
one-of-a-kind pieces of jewelry without the high boutique price tag.
